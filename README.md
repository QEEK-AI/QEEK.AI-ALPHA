# QEEK.ai — Repo-Aware Dev Tickets (Alpha)

QEEK is an experimental developer tool exploring a simple idea:

**Persistent project understanding should live with the repository — not inside AI chat sessions.**

---

## Why this exists

As AI tools are increasingly used for real development work, teams rely on long-running chat sessions to hold project context.

In practice, this leads to recurring failure modes:
- Context is summarized, degraded, or lost
- Chat history becomes unreliable or disappears
- Sessions freeze or timeout under heavy tool usage
- Developers restart sessions and manually rebuild state
- Important decisions live only inside transient chats

These issues are structural, not user error.

## What QEEK is exploring

QEEK focuses on one narrow workflow:

**Turning ideas and discussions into repo-aware, dev-ready tickets.**

Instead of depending on chat memory, QEEK:
- Grounds outputs directly in the codebase
- Preserves intent and scope as structured artifacts
- Produces tickets with concrete file and code references
- Treats AI sessions as disposable, not authoritative

The goal is not better chat memory —  
the goal is **less dependence on chat as long-term memory**.

## What QEEK is (and is not)

**QEEK is:**
- Repo-aware (code-structure aware, not prompt-only)
- Focused on planning and handoff, not live coding
- Designed to keep project state outside AI sessions

**QEEK is not:**
- An IDE
- A coding agent
- A replacement for Cursor, Copilot, or chat tools

## Alpha scope

This repository supports a **limited alpha**.

- Stage: Early, experimental
- Access: 1 month of free alpha access
- Privacy: Fully private — no code or repository data is uploaded or retained
- Audience: Developers and teams working on real, non-trivial codebases
- Expectation: Willingness to provide feedback

This is not a polished product.

## How to participate

If this problem resonates with you:

1. Open a new issue in this repository titled:  
   **`Alpha access request — <short description>`**

2. In the issue, include:
   - The problem you are experiencing
   - The tools you are currently using
   - What breaks down in your workflow today

If you prefer a private conversation, you can also reach us via:

This is a small, community-driven experiment.  
We are intentionally keeping the alpha focused while validating the approach.
